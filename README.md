# iNeuron_HeartDiseaseDiagnosis
During my internship with iNeuron.ai, I worked independently on an end-to-end project "Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis"
Heart Disease Diagnosis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python and Visualization Dashboards in Tableau and Power BI
## Introduction
This Kaggle project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to gain insights and build visualization dashboards using Tableau and Power BI. The goal is to explore the data, identify patterns, correlations, and factors that might contribute to heart disease diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to patients' health, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc. The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. Data Collection: The dataset is obtained from a reliable source and can be accessed through Kaggle.

2. Data Preprocessing: Before performing EDA, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, data encoding, and any other necessary data cleaning steps.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Python and libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we analyze the dataset to gain insights into various health attributes and their relationship with heart disease. Some of the key visualizations include:

   3.1. Distribution of heart disease cases.

   3.2. Age and gender-wise distribution.

   3.3. Correlation between different features and heart disease.

   3.4. Cholesterol and blood pressure trends.

   3.5. Heart disease across different age groups, etc.


4. Tableau Dashboard: The insights obtained from EDA are visualized and presented in Tableau to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. These dashboards allow users to explore the data and gain a deeper understanding of the factors influencing heart disease diagnosis.

5. Power BI Dashboard: Additionally, the project includes a Power BI dashboard with interactive visualizations that provide a different perspective on the data, allowing for comprehensive analysis and exploration.

## Usage
1. To reproduce or explore the project, follow these steps:

2. Download the heart disease dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate data folder.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (Python) for EDA and data preprocessing to generate insights and clean the data for visualization.

4. Utilize the cleaned dataset to create Tableau and Power BI dashboards. The data should be connected to the dashboards to visualize the results interactively.

5. Modify and customize the visualizations to suit your preferences or include additional insights if needed.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

Python (with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
Tableau (latest version)
Power BI (latest version)
Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries using pip and download the latest versions of Tableau and Power BI from their official websites.

## Conclusion
The heart disease diagnosis project showcases the power of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and the creation of interactive visualization dashboards in Tableau and Power BI. By combining data analysis and visualization, we can better understand the underlying patterns and correlations, ultimately contributing to improved decision-making and insights in the medical domain.

Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and adapt the project for other datasets or further research.
